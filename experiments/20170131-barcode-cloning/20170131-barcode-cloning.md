## Goals

1. Talked with Tony (collaborator, Blainey lab), and we agreed that barcoding would be a good idea, just for proof of concept.
    1. Insert a 10-mer into the sequence, right after the CDS.
1. Chat with Richard (CEO, Quintara Bio), got quote of $199/clone.
1. We will send in 10 clones to make barcodes on, including positive and negative controls.

## Clones to barcode

1. Vic
1. WSN - approx. same activity as Vic.
1. 8BM - approx. 1/6 activity of Vic.
1. L1 - approx. 2% activity of Vic.
1. L10 - knockout mutant.
1. L24 - knockout mutant.
1. L3 - knockout mutant.

Sent the following materials to Quintara Bio.

- Plasmid sequences and plasmid maps
    1. Vic in pCI.
    1. WSN in pCI.
    1. 8BM in pCI.
- Plasmids:
    1. Vic
    1. WSN
    1. 8BM
    1. L1
    1. L10
    1. L24
    1. L3
