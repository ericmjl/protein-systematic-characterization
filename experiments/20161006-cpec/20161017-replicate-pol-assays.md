## Goals

- perform two separate replicate experiments of previous [pol assay experiment](../20160805-mutagenesis/20160928-cpec-pol-assay.md)

## Protocol

- Started new culture of 293T cells as per [protocol](../../protocols/cell-culture.md)

### Gel Electrophoresis

- 1% w/v agar 150mL gel
- 10 ul loading dye, 1:10 loading dye
- 30 min @ 150V

**Analysis**
- warped nature of gel is likely due to problems during gel solidification
- pCI fragments are the appropriate sizes, so they will be extracted. For pCI part 1, there is some ambiguity in the bands - I extracted the bottom half of the mush.
- Very faint PB2 part 2 band, indiscernible part 1 band - will re-run both with 0.25mM instead, since previous gel showed that 0.50mM yields very few PCR products.

### Gel Extraction

pCI part 1: 62mg
pCI part 2: 83mg

### Re-run PCR for PB2
