## Goals
- Plan out the adaption of pol assay protocol to 96-well plate

### New Equipment
- a multi-channel aspirator is in the works, but for now I will use a multi-channel pipette to efficiently remove medium from wells

### Plate Seeding

How long to achieve 80% confluence? To start with, I will try seeding ~140K cells per well with the expectation, based on previous experiments with 12-well plates, that the cell count will quadruple in one day to 560K. ~80% confluence for a 12-well plate represented about 4.5 million cells per well, and we are estimating the area of a 96-well plate well to be 1/8 that of a 12-well plate well.
