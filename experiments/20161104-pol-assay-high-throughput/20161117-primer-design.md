### Primers for sequencing entire PB2 sequence

Forward: ends 100bp upstream of end of pCI sequence
Reverse: ends 100bp downstream of start of pCI sequence

Forward: AGGCACCTATTGGTCTTACTGA (22-mer, Tm = 57C, %GC = 45)
Reverse: CATCACAAATTTCACAAATAAAGCATTTT (29-mer, Tm = 55C, %GC = 24)

Melting temperatures calculated by APE.
