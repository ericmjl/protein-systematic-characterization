## Goals
- re-do the dilution assay
- replicate PB2 mutant assay

### Working Protocol
**Seeding**
1. After counting cells in 1mL of cell-DMEM solution, determine solution volume/well needed for 30000 cells/well.
2. May need to dilute by at least 2x in order to have sufficient volume in tray to use multi-channel pipette. If so, plate 10mL passaging plates first.
3. Pipette cells into wells. Fill wells with 400ul of DMEM. Mix well.
**Transfection**
1. Prepare 1.1*(# of replicates)x volume of transfection mixtures in strip tubes.
For one replicate:
2. Set aside 31.25ul OPTI-MEM each for mock, PHH, and PCD. Mix 309ul OPTI-MEM (1.1*31.25ul*9) (for 8 mutants + 1 Vic) with 1.1ul of each non-PB2 plasmid.
3. Mix 420ul OPTI-MEM with 4.2ul lipofectamine. Let sit for 5 min.
4. Distribute 310ul of mix into each tube. Add 1ul of appropriate PB2 variant.
5. Vortex tubes. Distribute 31.6ul lipofectamine mix into each tube. Let sit for 20 min.
6. Add 32 ul of appropriate transfection mixture to each well.


2016-11-17 Notes:
- 2.7 million cells/mL -> added 3mL of DMEM to the 1mL solution, seeded 4ul of diluted solution for 30000 cells/well.
- **Dilution:** Seeded three wells each of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 dilutions. 1:1 contained 30000 cells.
