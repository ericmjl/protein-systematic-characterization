# Overview

The goals for this experiment are as follows:

1. [ ] Clone and Sanger sequence a single barcoded plasmid.
1. [ ] Test barcode positions just upstream and just downstream of PB2 sequence, to make sure it doesn't affect activity.
    1. If needed test other positions.
1. [ ] Assemble random mutagenesis PCR product with barcode and backbone.
1. [ ]
