## Goals

The [last hacky-taq experiment](../20161006-hackytaq-replicates/20161006-hackytaq-replicate.md) I ran showed results that were inconsistent with the results that Vivian had from [her run](../20160920-Taq-Mn-mutagenesis/20160912-mgcl2-taq-series.md). Briefly:

1. Vivian's experiments yielded PCR products that, when Sanger-sequenced, showed on the order of 1-10 mutations across the PCR product.
1. On the other hand, my PCR products showed on the order of 100s of mutations.
1. Additionally, my no-manganese control (which I expected to have 0 to few mutations) showed hundreds of mutations as well.

I repeated the experiment with the following modifications:

1. Instead of doing triplicates, only ran single PCR reactions per concentration of manganese.
1. I had Vivian observe my setting up of the experiments.
1. I tested the following concentrations:
    1. 0.0 mM
    1. 0.05 mM
    1. 0.1 mM
    1. 0.2 mM
    1. 0.25 mM
    1. 0.30 mM
    1. 0.35 mM
    1. 0.4 mM
    1. 0.5 mM
