## Goals

My previous hackytaq test yielded poor sequencing results. It may be because I didn't do gel purification post-PCR, yielding mixed bands. I will try one last time today, this time doing gel purification of the PCR product.

## PCR reactions

Here are the reaction conditions recorded for convenience.
