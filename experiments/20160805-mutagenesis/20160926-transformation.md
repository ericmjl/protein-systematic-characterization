## Goals

1. Transform the CPEC mix that [Vivian made](./20160908-cpec.md).
1. Propagate Victoria PB2 plasmid (it's also the positive control for transformation).

## Protocol

Followed the [transformation protocol](../protocols/transformation.md) in the [protocols directory](../protocols/).

Amount of DNA used:
- CPEC mix: everything, did not quantify concentration of DNA.
- Victoria PB2 plasmid: 5 µL.

Did two platings: one with 100 µL of recovery culture, one with "the rest" of the recovery culture.

## Results

| Transformation | Scale  | # Colonies |
|----------------|--------|------------|
| CPEC           | 100 µL | 4          |
| CPEC           | Rest   | TNTC       |
| VicPB2         | 100 µL | TNTC       |
| VicPB2         | Rest   | TNTC       |

- Note: "TNTC" stands for "too numerous to count", i.e. >30

## Colony Picking

- Picked 4 colonies from VicPB2 to grow up and miniprep (tubes are labelled "VIC (1)...(4)").
- Picked 16 colonies from CPEC library to grow up and miniprep (tubes are labelled "LIB (1)...(16)").

Each tube had 2 mL LB-Amp.

## Miniprep

Followed the Qiagen Miniprep protocol. No exceptions occurred. DNA concentrations are [here](./20160928-library-concentration.tsv).

The naming system is as follows:

- V1-4: stands for "V"ictoria PB2, colonies 1-4.
- L1-16: stands for "L"ibrary, colonies 1-16.
