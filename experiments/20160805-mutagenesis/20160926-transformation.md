## Goals

1. Transform the CPEC mix that [Vivian made](./20160908-cpec.md).
1. Propagate Victoria PB2 plasmid (it's also the positive control for transformation).

## Protocol

Followed the [transformation protocol](../protocols/transformation.md) in the [protocols directory](../protocols/).

Amount of DNA used:
- CPEC mix: everything, did not quantify concentration of DNA.
- Victoria PB2 plasmid: 5 µL.

Did two platings: one with 100 µL of recovery culture, one with "the rest" of the recovery culture.

## Results

| Transformation | Scale  | # Colonies |
|----------------|--------|------------|
| CPEC           | 100 µL | 4          |
| CPEC           | Rest   | TNTC       |
| VicPB2         | 100 µL | TNTC       |
| VicPB2         | Rest   | TNTC       |

- Note: "TNTC" stands for "too numerous to count", i.e. >30

## Next Steps

- Picked 4 colonies from VicPB2 to grow up and miniprep (tubes are labelled "VIC (1)...(4)").
- Picked 16 colonies from CPEC library to grow up and miniprep (tubes are labelled "LIB (1)...(16)").
