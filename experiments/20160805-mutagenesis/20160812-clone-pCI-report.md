# Goals

1. [ ] Amplify just pCI in fragments, see if this reaction works or not.

# Experiment setup

- Part 1:
  - Fw primer: EM-15
  - Re primer: EM-14
  - PCR product size: 2693 bp
- Part 2:
  - Fw primer: EM-7
  - Re primer: EM-6
  - PCR product size: 1360 bp

Tube order (left to right):

1. Part 1 (labelled "P1")
1. Water-only control (labelled "W")
1. Part 2 (labelled "P2")
1. Template-only control (labelled "T")

4 PCR reactions - therefore make 4.4X master mix of 50 µL reactions. (I am going for 50 µL this time round because there was very little to work with using 20 µL reactions.)
