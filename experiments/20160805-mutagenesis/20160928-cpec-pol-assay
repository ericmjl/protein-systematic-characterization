## Goals

- Identify polymerase plasmids with successfully mutated PB2 part 2 fragment from [CPEC library](./201609260transformation.md) for sequencing
- Expecting luminescence results for mutants to be distinct from results for the template

### Cell culture

Followed [cell culture protocol](protocols/cell-culture.md) for preparing for polymerase assay.
Cells were grown in 1:10 concentration, and used at 80% confluence after one day incubation period.

### Transfection

Followed [transfection protocol](protocols/transfection.md) using the following testing setup.

**Assay Wells**

|   | 1    | 2    | 3   | 4   |
|---|------|------|-----|-----|
| A | Mock | Mock | PCD | PHH |
| B | V1   | L1   | L3  | L4  |
| C | L6   | L10  | L11 | L16 |

- Mock: same amount of OPTI-MEM medium and lipofectamine added, but no plasmids
- PCD: Positively-constituted reporter
- PHH: only Gluc reporter gene added
- V1: full template polymerase plasmid, no mutations
- L1-L16: polymerase plasmids with mutated PB2 part 2
