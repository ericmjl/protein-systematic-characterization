## Goals

- Use CPEC assembly to generate full plasmid composed of four fragments: [pCI part 1](./20160831-mutagenesis.md), [pCI part 2](./20160902-mutagenesis-2.md), [PB2 part 1](./20160907-pb2-pt1-mytaq.md), and [PB2 part 2](./20160907-DMSO-mutagenesis). Only the last was produced in error-prone conditions.

## Setup

**CPEC Assembly Mix**

| Reagent     | Volume (ul) |
|-------------|-------------|
| Water       | 14          |
| PCR Product | 9 of each   |
| Kapa 2x     | 50          |
| Total       | 100         |

**Notes:**
- Since the respective PCR products were in relatively equimolar solutions, equal volumes of each was used.

**Protocol**

Used the Kapa program with standard 65C annealing temperature.
