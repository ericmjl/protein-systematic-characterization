## CPEC Assembly Protocol

Starting materials:
- PCR products that are to be stitched together.
  - Best if they are equimolar, but not necessary; the final amount of plasmid is going to be limited by the PCR product that is of the lowest concentration.
- Kapa HF or Phusion polymerase master mix

## Overview

- Total reaction volume: 50 µL: this allows for as much PCR product as needed to be added.

## Protocol

Mix the following together:
- 25 µL polymerase master mix
- 1 µL 100% DMSO (final concentration: 2%)
- equal volumes of gel extracted PCR products, max total volume 24 µL
- Top off with water to 50 µL if needed.

## PCR Program

Use Phusion or Kapa program.
- Extension time should be 30 sec/kb, done for the length of the full plasmid.
- Annealing temperature should be set to 65ºC.

## Downstream steps

- **PCR Purification:** Use the QIAquick PCR Purification kit to clean up the DNA.
- **Transformation:** Use chemical transformation or electroporation. Plate on appropriate antibiotic resistance plate.
