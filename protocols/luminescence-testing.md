## Goals

Test luciferase activity in polymerase assay.

## Prep

1. Centrifuge samples.
2. Add 20ul of each sample into wells.
3. Add guassia luciferase (gluc) substrate (leave in freezer till last minute) to gluc buffer in about 1:100 v/v. Add 50ul of mixture into each well.

## Testing

1. The Varioskan machine is in room 68-316.
2. Use wavelength of 480nm.
3. Use well plate 96-well, BM Falcon clear/white tray
