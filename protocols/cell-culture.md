## Objective
Plate and grow eukaryotic cells for transfection.

**Plate from frozen state**
1. Add 10mL DMEM growth medium (+ growth factors) to tissue culture plate.
2. Move cells from -80C to 37C water bath.
3. Add 1mL cells to medium, slowly. Gently shake plate to cover. Incubate in 37C. Split about 3 days.

Notes:
-  during growth, check that the medium is red. If it's yellow, it's acidic, which is indicative of overgrowth or bacterial contamination.
- during growth, check every day to make sure cells are growing in a monolayer
- cells complete a full division around once a day

**Tripsonizing and splitting cultures**

Disaggregating cultures into individual cells and separate cells from medium.
1. Remove medium with vacuum.
2. Add about 15mL of PBS to wash - gently to bottom of well plate so that cells are not detached. Let sit, then remove PBS.
3. Add 5mL of Trypsin. Incubate in 37C for 10-15 min, or until cells have all detached from plate.
4. Pipette out cell/Trypsin mixture into a 50mL conical tube. Add 2x volume of DMEM to reduce Trypsin activity.
5. Centrifuge to form pellet at 1500 rpm for 5 min, 4C.
6. Resuspend pellet with 1mL of DMEM.
7. Add appropriate volume of cells to new plates depending on desired concentration (add 100ul for 1:10)
8. Add 10ml of DMEM to plates.
9. Incubate in 37C.

**Preparing for polymerase assay**

Select healthiest looking plate and follow tripsonizing procedure up to re-plating (up to step 7). Then divide up cell mixture evenly between wells in a polymerase assay plate. Proceed as above.
