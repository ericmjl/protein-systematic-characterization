# Random Mutagenesis Protocol

**Use Case:** Use this protocol to generate random mutants off a starting template. Follows the Agilent GeneMorph II protocol, but rewritten for ease at the bench.

## Required Materials

1. Forward and reverse primers for amplification.
1. DNA Template that needs to be mutated.
1. Agilent GeneMorph II kit.

## Procedure

1. Use the associated protocol calculator (in the directory `src/apps/calculators/mutagenesis.py`) to determine input DNA volumes required.
1. Set up the PCR as described in the protocol calculator.

## Checking Results

If you are doing this for the first time, send in 10 clones for Sanger sequencing to determine that there there are approximately the expected number of mutants present in each one.
