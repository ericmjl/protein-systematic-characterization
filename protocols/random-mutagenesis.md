# Random Mutagenesis Protocol

**Use Case:** Use this protocol to generate random mutants off a starting template.

**Inputs:**
1. Template DNA
1. Primers for amplification
1. Agilent GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit

**Outputs:**
1. PCR product containing mutants in amplified region.

## Required Materials

1. Forward and reverse primers for amplification.

## Procedure

1.

## Checking Results

If you are doing this for the first time, send in 10 clones for Sanger sequencing to determine that there there are approximately the expected number of mutants present in each one.
