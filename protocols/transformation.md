# Overview

This is a summary of the DH5-alpha sub-cloning efficiency transformation protocol ([original](./dh5-alpha-subclone.pdf)).

# Materials Required

- DH5-alpha cells
- DNA to be transformed (concentration: at least 1 ng/µL)
- Ice
- SOC Media
- Antibiotic selection plates

# Equipment Required

- Heat block set at 42ºC
- Shaking incubator set at 37ºC

# Protocol

1. Thaw competent cells on **wet** ice.
1. Pre-chill 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice as well.
1. 1 transformation should use 50 µL of competent cells; aliquot the number of transformations required.
1. Add 1-5 µL of DNA into cells and mix gently.
1. Incubate tubes on ice for 30 min.
1. Heat tubes for 1 min at 42ºC. Use heat block.
1. Chill tubes on ice for 2 min.
1. Add 950 µL SOC media, incubate for 1 hour.
1. Spin cells down at [how fast?] g, re-suspend in 100 µL of SOC, and spread plate on antibiotic selection plates.
1. Incubate plates O/N at 37ºC.
1. The next day, pick colonies for growth and sequencing.
