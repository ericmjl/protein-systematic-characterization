## Objective

Transfect plasmids (viral) into eukaryotic cells for polymerase assay.

1. Calculate volume of each plasmid needed - want 0.5ug of each. Concentration of plasmid in solution is labeled on tube.
2. Add 250ul OPTI-MEM into reaction Eppendorf tubes.
3. Add reagents as follows (0.5ug each):
  - Tests (viruses): 4 viral plasmids + reporter gene with reverse promoter
  - Positive control: reporter with constitutively activated promoter
  - Negative control: reporter with reverse promoter
  - Negative control: nothing
4. Mix reaction solutions.
5. Add 250ul OPTI-MEM to a set of new tubes.
6. Add 2.5ul transfection reagent to each tube. Mix.
7. Let stand for 5 min.
8. Add transfection reagent mixture to plasmid mixture.
9. Let stand 20 min.
10. Vacuum out cell culture medium from assay wells.
11. Carefully add (pipette) the transfection mixtures into wells. Label.
12. Incubate 4 hours, then change medium to 1mL DMEM.
13. After 48 hours, take out 100-200ul of solution out of each well, store in tubes, and freeze in American freezer.
