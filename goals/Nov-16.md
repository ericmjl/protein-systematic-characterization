## Goals for Nov 17 - Nov 22

### Experiments
- Run another high-throughput experiment, with a clearer, modified protocol.
  - Specifically, the serial dilution to measure polymerase expression as a function of number of cells should be repeated with better mixing
- Sequence fully mutated PB2 plasmids
- Start messing around with PacBio?

### Data Analysis
- Setup a procedure for efficiently organizing luminescence data
- Figure out what normalization standard to use
