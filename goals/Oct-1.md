## Goals for Oct. 3 - 14

### Experiments
**Week 1**
- **Oct 3**: Luminescence testing with cpec library polymerase assay. Send for sequencing mutants that produce statistically distinct results.
- **Oct 4**: Learn proper tc technique from Kim.
- **Oct 5**: I have an interview in the afternoon, so probably can't come into lab.
- **Oct 6**: Purify and send for sequencing hacky-taq PCR products from mutagenesis with [Mn] of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 (mM).
Justification: Preliminary results from comparing [Mn] of 0, 2.5, and 5.5 indicate that more mutations occurred with 2.5mM than with 5.5mM (0mM: 1, 2.5mM: 8, 5.5mM: 3)
- **Oct 7**: Analyze results from cpec sequencing.

**Week 2**
- Successfully produce mutated PCR products of PB2 part 1, either with Agilent as before (try cutting it into even smaller fragments?) or with hacky-taq, if one of the concentrations reliably induces a respectable number of mutations.


### Computational
**Week 1**
- simulate coin_flip and tcm bayesian analysis with thinkbayes methods + Chapter 2 of Think Bayes
- still need to figure out Biopython...seem to be having trouble with reading files
- learn how to parse luminescence excel data into flat files
- learn the statistical way to analyze luminescence data
**Week 2**
- Chapter 3 of Think Bayes
- now might be a good time to start learning to manage databases
