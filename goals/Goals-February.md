## Goals for the month of February

###Cleaning up current code
- Edit overlaps such that original sequence DNA is used for each sequence's set of tiles
- Add identical 15-mer annealing ends to the 5' and 3' tiles, checking that the new tile length does not exceed 200bp

###Applying graph theory
- Simulate the ratio of original to new PB2 sequences that would be present in a sequence pool generated through tiled synthesis, given different mismatch capacities from 0 to 5 mismatches per overlaps
- Test algorithm with a random sampling of the 2969 sequences
