# Project Goals for 2016-2017

## Goals for the Year
**Baseline**
1. Generate 3 PB2 random mutation libraries
2. Conduct polymerase assay with (5) library plates
- Model error propagation from plate measurements to a linear model

**Bonus**
1. Make library sequencing more cost-efficient with the PacBio method
- Conduct live virus test on select clones

## Milestones by Semester
### Fall
**By the end of October**
- **Assay**
  - replicate Islam's previous experiment with point mutation
  - shrink reaction volumes to increase reaction quantity
- **Library creation**
  - PCR to generate random mutant viral plasmids
  - transformation
  - DNA sequencing

**By the end of November**
- Generate one complete library with repeated pol measurements
- Data analysis of measurements
- Setup for future machine learning
