#Goals for Oct 17 - Oct 28

### Experiments
**Week 1**
- **Oct 17**: Start new 293T cell culture for pol assay; hacky-taq PCR with PB2 parts 1 and 2
- **Oct 18**: Run gel to check for bands and purify PCR products
- **Oct 19**: Split culture 1) into wells for Pol Assay Replicate 1, ready in one day; 2) into wells for Pol Assay Replicate 2, ready in two days; 3) into another dish for future experiments
- **Oct 20**: Transfect Rep 1
- **Oct 21**: Transfect Rep 2

**Week 2**
- **Oct 24**: Luminescence testing for Reps 1 and 2
- **Oct 25**: PCR amplification of pCI parts 1 and 2
- **Oct 26**: PCR purification of pCI fragments; CPEC Assembly
- **Oct 27**: Transformation with PB2 CPEC plasmid


### Computational
**Week 1**
- hierarchical Bayesian modeling with luminescence data
- learn how to parse luminescence excel data into flat files
- learn the statistical way to analyze luminescence data
**Week 2**
- learn how to work with databases with new pol assay data and hacky-taq sequences

### Paperwork
**Week 1**
- outline of UROP proposal
**Week 2**
- final draft of UROP proposal
